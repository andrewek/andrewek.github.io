Hello! Welcome!

This is where I write about things. Most of those things are related to
programming, but some are about management, parenting, teaching, or even
non-profit administration (all relevant areas of experience, if not expertise).

I mostly use Ruby, Javascript, and Elixir when writing software.

Most of my code is not public, but you can view my [GitHub
page](https://github.com/andrewek) if you feel so inclined. You can also [tweet
with me](https://twitter.com/ektastrophe) or [instagram with
me](https://www.instagram.com/ektastrophe/). Or I'm [on
LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-ek-761aa24a/)?

I also maintain a [weekly-ish newsletter](https://andrewek.substack.com/).

The world is a weird place. But at least it has dogs.
