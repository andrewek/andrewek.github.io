Hello, and welcome! I'm Andrew Ek. I'm a senior software engineer with
[PaymentSpring](https://www.paymentspring.com), where I work on things like
real-time, filterable notifications, integrations with payment processors, fraud
detection, and guiding merchants who integrate with our API. Professionally, I
use Ruby, Elixir, and Javascript, plus smatterings of PHP, Python, Java, and
shell scripting. I have lots of strongly held opinions about how developers
communicate and collaborate, and not very many strongly held opinions about
programming languages or frameworks.

In my spare time, I hang out with my much-cooler-than-me wife and kiddo, as well
as our ennui-stricken cat (also cooler than me). We collectively enjoy food,
board games, pickleball, running around, books, and high-fives. I also get into
macro photography when the opportunity presents itself (mostly of flowers and
bugs).

In my previous professional life, I was a poet, a teacher (writing, math, and
computer science), a non-profit administrator, and far more able to eat a whole
pizza by myself than I am now.
