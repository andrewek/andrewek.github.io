Hi, and welcome! I'm Andrew Ek. I do lots of things, but the things I do during
my day job mostly involve writing software, working with organizations to make
sure their developers are learning and growing, and building new products and
services.

In my spare time, I hang out with my much-cooler-than-me wife and kiddo, as well
as our ennui-stricken cat (also cooler than me). We collectively enjoy food,
board games, pickleball, running around, books, and high-fives. I enjoy taking
photos, petting dogs and cats, and being kind.

In my previous professional life, I was a poet, a teacher (writing, math, and
computer science), a non-profit administrator, and far more able to eat a whole
pizza by myself than I am now.
